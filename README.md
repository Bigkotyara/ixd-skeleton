# TapMusic
COGS 120 - Interaction Design Project

### Point of View:
Satisfying a music craving should be a one tap away, saving you time and energy. The experience should be about enjoying music and achieving your goals, rather than looking for the next appropriate song.

### User Base:
TapMusic is a mobile web application for busy people who want quick, setting-appropriate music and do not have time to create playlists. This includes people who frequently use a phone while music is already playing.

### Core Interaction:
When the application is opened, users are greeted with a diverse selection of icons on the home screen. The icons represent either mood or activity-based playlists. Icons appear more prominently after frequent use. Once the user taps an icon, music satisfying the user's requirements for a given mood/activity will play instantly. For further customization, users are able to add 'ignore' tags from a menu. This filters out any music the user doesn't want to play.
